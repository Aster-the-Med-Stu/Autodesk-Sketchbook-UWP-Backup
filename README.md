## Background

Autodesk Sketchbook UWP is removed from Microsoft Store. And due to Autodesk (and the new Sketchbook company) dropping support for UWP package, the old blog might disapper for some day, and I believe it's the time to have a copy of those contents. Extra brushes have already disappeared but luckily I do have a copy of all the contents.

## FAQs

### Why do you insist on using Sketchbook built on deprecated UWP technology (Said by Microsoft)?

Because its touch support is way better than the Win32 version. If you have tried UWP version on some touchscreen-enabled device like Surface, you'd know that it's marvelous, letting alone Surface Dial support.

What's more, Copic colour picker is removed from newer versions. Copic palette is something that I already get familiar with...

### It crashes ðŸ™€

That does happen if you created a canvas too big and free mem is not sufficient enough. Don't panic, UWP version has auto-save mechanism. Relaunch the app, and your work should still be there ðŸ˜¹

### But hey! Why are you only sharing UWP version? Doesn't Autodesk Sketchbook have Win32, MacOS, blahblah?

As Sketchbook company sprunt out of Autodesk, and the app itself once again becomes a paidware, I think I should support awesome developers behind this app. I do still have student license from Autodesk but the new company needs funding for future app improvements. So... Sorry, please pay for the new Sketchbook on other platforms.
