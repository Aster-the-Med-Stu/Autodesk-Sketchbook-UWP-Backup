# Autodesk-Sketchbook-UWP-Backup

For the UWP app, [click here to download the UWP finale (Ver 5.1.0.0)](https://github.com/Aster-the-Med-Stu/Autodesk-Sketchbook-UWP-Backup/raw/main/89006A2E.AutodeskSketchBook_5.1.0.0_x64__tf1gferkr813w.Appx).

For brushes, check the brush folder above.

## Background

Autodesk Sketchbook UWP is removed from Microsoft Store. And due to Autodesk (and the new Sketchbook company) dropping support for UWP package, the old blog might disapper for some day, and I believe it's the time to have a copy of those contents. Extra brushes have already disappeared but luckily I do have a copy of all the contents.

### But hey! Why are you only sharing UWP version? Doesn't Autodesk Sketchbook have Win32, MacOS, blahblah?

As Sketchbook company sprunt out of Autodesk, and the app itself once again becomes a paidware, I think I should support awesome developers behind this app. I do still have student license from Autodesk but the new company needs funding. So... Sorry, please pay for the new Sketchbook on other platforms.
